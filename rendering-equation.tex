\subsection{Fresnels Reflection and Transmittance}

If we consider the intensity of the light detected by the sensor, $ L_{sensor}$, we can
effectively decompose the sources into two components: the reflection off of the air-water
interface (air-to-air) $L_{reflected}$, and a proportion of the reflectance off of
the disk underwater, $K \cdot L_{transimitted}$. Where
$ K$ is determined by Rendering equation as the concentration of particulates as a parameter.

Given the ambient atmospheric light intenstiy, $L_{atm}$, by energy considerations we can say
$$L_{atm} = L_{reflected}+L_{transmitted}$$

\subsubsection{Reflectance}
Since the incident light is unpolarized, the reflectance is given
by the average of S-polarized and P-polarized light. As an approximation
for a given incident angle $\theta$, we can use Schlick's approximation to obtain
reflectance R.
$$ R(\theta) = \left(\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}\right)^2 +
 \left(1-\left(\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}\right)^2\right)\left(1-cos(\theta)\right)^5 $$
where, $ n_1$ is the index of refraction of the incident media (air in our case)
and $ n_2$ is the index of refracton of the reflected media (water = 1.33).

Since the reflectance is wavelength independent, we have,

$$ L_{reflected} = R \cdot L_{atm}$$

\subsubsection{Transmittance}
\marginnote{In practice considering the reflection may be trivial as at $ \theta = 0$
the maximum reflectance is $\approx 3\%$ and has a significant effect at higher incident
angles only $(>60 \degree)$.}

We can relate the transmittance $ T$ of the unpolarized light with
the reflectance $ R$ as
$$ T = 1 - R$$

We have the transmitted light into the water as,

$$ L_{transmitted} = T \cdot L_{atm} $$

The attenuation $ L_{transmitted}$ due to chlorophyll absoprtion and reflection
on the disk is discussed in the following sections.



\subsection{Rendering Equation}

The interaction of incident, reflected, and emmited light at any given point on a
given surface is
described by the general Rendering Equation,

\begin{equation}
  L_o = L_e + L_r
\end{equation}
Where, $L_o$ is the light leaving the particular point, $ L_e$ is the light emitted
from the point (if it is a source), and $L_r $ is the light reflected from that point.

Since we will be working with non-light generating disks, we set,
$ L_e = 0$.
The light reflected off of the surface of a disk, can be calculated using the
Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)[3].
For a given point on a surface, the general BRDF is,

\begin{equation}
\rho_d(\phi_0, \theta_0,\phi_f, \theta_f)=\frac{L_r{\phi_f, \theta_f}}{L_I{\phi_0, \theta_0}}
\end{equation}
Where $\phi_0, \theta_0$ are the incident azimuthal and polar angle of the light source,
and $\phi_f, \theta_0$ are the azimuthal and polar angle with respect to the viewer and
and relfected point.

From the general rendering equation, the reflected radiance is given by

\begin{equation}
  L_r = \int^{2\pi}_{\phi_i = 0}\int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{\theta_i = 0}
  f_r L_s T(d)cos(\theta_i)sin(\theta_i)d\theta_i d\phi_i
\end{equation}

Where, the $ f_r$ is Lambertian BRDF.

The transmission function $T(d)$ can be related to the depth of the reflecting
surface.

\subsection{Beer-Lambert Law}

The Beer-Lambert provides us with a linear relationship betweem incident light, absorbed light,
and concentration of absorbed light.

The wavelength dependent relation is given as,

\begin{equation}
  \epsilon d c = Log_{10}{\frac{I_0}{I_f}}
\end{equation}
where, $\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity in $ L \cdot cm^{-1} \cdot mol^{-1}$,
$ d$ is the depth in $cm$, $ C$ is the concentration in $mol \cdot L^{-1} $. $ I_0$
is the initial light intensity, and $ I_f$ is the final intensity after
absorption.

Given some incident light of radiance, $L_0$, on the water surface,

we have the decomposed radiance as
$$ L_0 = L_{sa} + L_{s}$$
where, $ L_{sa}$ is the absorbed light radiation. $ L_{s}$ is the light
incident on the point under water and being reflected by the disk.

According to the Beer-Lambert Law we have the relation,

\begin{equation}
  Log_{10}\left(\frac{L_0}{L_{s}}\right) = \frac{\epsilon d C}{cos(\theta)}
\end{equation}
and,
\begin{equation}
  T(d) = 10^\frac{-\epsilon d C}{cos(\theta)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reflectance}

Since we want to specifically take into account the
absorbance due to chlorophyll a, we limit the consideration
to considering the radiance of light at $\lambda = 662nm$

Even though the incident light is poloychromatic, but since we are considering the specific wavelength
and the incident light is so spread out, we can reasonably treat it as monochromatic. (?)

The reflectance in the particular frequency then becomes,

\begin{equation}
  L_{r \lambda} = \int^{2\pi}_{\phi_i = 0}\int^{\theta_c}_{\theta_i = 0}
  f_r L_{s\lambda} 10^\frac{-\epsilon d C}{cos(\theta)}cos(\theta_i)sin(\theta_i)d\theta_i d\phi_i
\end{equation}
\marginnote{The cutoff angle should ideally vary with the azimuthal position of the sun, time of day and the lattitude of position.}
Here we sum the incident angle upto some cutoff angle $\theta_c$, as the higher incident lights
have negligible effect on the reflected light.


We can further make an assumption that the secchi disk is perfectly matte with rotationally
invariant reflectance. The Lambertian BRDF is thus,

\begin{equation}
  f_r = \frac{\rho_D}{\pi}
\end{equation}
Where, $ \rho_D$ is the albedo of the secchi disk with $ 0 \leq \rho_D \leq 1$
Combining (4) and (5) we get the reflectance off of the surface of secchi disk as,

\begin{equation}
  L_{r \lambda} = \int^{2\pi}_{\phi_i = 0}\int^{\theta_c}_{\theta_i = 0}
  \frac{\rho_D}{\pi} L_{s\lambda} 10^\frac{-\epsilon d C}{cos(\theta)}cos(\theta_i)sin(\theta_i)d\theta_i d\phi_i
\end{equation}

Chlorophyll a has an extinction coefficient of $ \epsilon_{663} = 0.088 \frac{cm^{-1}}{g}$ at 663nm.
Since the light collected by the camera will have had to travel up the water column we must add
another absorbance factor determined by the equation 2.

The light incident on the camera is therefore,
\begin{align}
  L_{i 663} = \int^{2\pi}_{\phi_i = 0}\int^{\theta_c}_{\theta_i = 0}
  \frac{\rho_D}{\pi}  L_{s 663} 10^\frac{-2\epsilon d C}{cos(\theta)}cos(\theta_i)sin(\theta_i)d\theta_i d\phi_i
\end{align}
\subsection{Analytic Solution}
Equation (10) can be solved analytically for a light source which is at angle $\theta_0$ to $ \theta_{c}$.
The concentration of the chlorophyll, c, can be retrieved by,
\begin{align}
  C &= Log_{10}\left [ \int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_c} \int_{0}^{2\pi}
        \frac{\rho_D}{\pi} \frac{L_{s 663}} {L_{i 663}} 10^\frac{-2\epsilon d}{cos(\theta)}cos(\theta_i)sin(\theta_i)d\theta_i d\phi_i\right]
    \\ &= Log_{10}\left[2 \rho_D \frac{L_{s 663}} {L_{i 663}} 10^{-2\epsilon d}\int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_c} 10^\frac{1 }{cos(\theta)}cos(\theta_i)sin(\theta_i)d\theta_i\right]
    \\ &= Log_{10}\left[2 \rho_D \frac{L_{s 663}} {L_{i 663}} 10^{-2\epsilon d} \left( \left. \frac{-ln(10)cos(\theta_i)+1}{ln^2(10)10^{cos(\theta_i)}}\right\rvert^{\theta_c}_{\theta_0}\right)\right]
\end{align}

In this case, $ \theta_c$ is less than the $ \frac{\pi}{3}$ so we can assume the
difference transmitted intensity is the same as the incident atmospheric intensity. The addition
of higher incident angles would make equation unsolvable analytically
(But I believe we can approximate using perturbation theory).


\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Set Up}
Using a lamp as a point source, we can measure the efficacy of the model. The set up for the experiment is
with a secchi disk positioned submerged at depth $d$, in a solution of water and particulates - possible food coloring
or something similar- with known absorption coefficients $ \epsilon$. We can use a lamp as the point source of light. Placing
the lamp at height $ H$ above the secchi disk, at an angle $\theta_a$.

\section{Numerical Simulations}

Carrying out a simplistic modelling of the rendering equation with the secchi disk albedo, $ \rho_d = 1$,
we can carry out the model the intensity percent ratio of reflected light absorbed by the camera and incident light on
the submerged secchi disk, $ \frac{L_{r663}}{L_{i 663}}$ with,
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.40]{ContourPlot}
\end{center}

The concentration ranges from $ 1 \cdot 10^{-7} mol\cdot L^{-1}$ to $5 \cdot 10^{-7} mol\cdot L^{-1}$. The depth being modeled
range from $10cm$ to $ 50cm$

Holding the concentration consant at $ 1 \cdot 10^{-7} mol\cdot L^{-1}$, we can model the
relationship between $ \frac{L_{r663}}{L_{i663}}$ and depth.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.4]{2dPlot}
\end{center}

Following the same procedure as before, keeping the depth constant at $ 20 cm$, we have the relationship between the
concentration and intensity ratio ($ \frac{L_{r663}}{L_{i663}}$).
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{2dPlotConcentration}
\end{center}

The simulations were carried out with numerical approximations in mathemtica and the cutoff angle angle used was $ \frac{\pi}{2.1}$.
($\frac{\pi}{2}$ creates a discontinuity in the integrand)
